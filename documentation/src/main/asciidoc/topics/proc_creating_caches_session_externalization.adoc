Create a cache on your {brandname} cluster to act as a remote store for HTTP session data.

Either `distributed-cache` or `replicated-cache` is suitable for most use cases. In general the caching strategy you use depends on the heap size of each {brandname} node as well as the expected session volume calculated as follows:

`session size * number of active sessions`

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot configure cache names on {brandname} when externalizing sessions from {tomcatbrandname}. The {brandname} session client stores all data to the `default` cache.
